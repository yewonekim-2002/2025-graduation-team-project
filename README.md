# Automatic English Vocabulary List Generation System
**2025 Graduation Team Project**

## 🔍 Overview
This project is a **user-centered English vocabulary learning system** designed to automatically generate personalized vocabulary lists based on users’ word search history.

Rather than focusing solely on dictionary lookup, the project emphasizes **user experience, interface design, and learning flow**, transforming word search behavior into structured learning content.

This repository is maintained as a **public portfolio project** to demonstrate frontend development, UI/UX design, and system-level thinking.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Most online English dictionaries and translation apps allow fast word searches but offer limited support for:

- Long-term vocabulary management  
- Personalized learning workflows  
- Reusing search history as learning material  

As a result, users repeatedly search the same words without an effective review or learning structure.

---

## 💡 Solution
This project proposes a system that:

- Automatically records word search history  
- Organizes searched words into vocabulary lists  
- Supports learning-oriented features such as review and repetition  

The focus of the project is on **how users interact with vocabulary data** and **how the interface supports continuous learning**.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Automatic word search history saving  
- Vocabulary list generation based on search behavior  
- Review-oriented learning flow  
- Word search statistics visualization  
- Learning tools:
  - Flashcards  
  - Quizzes  
  - Vocabulary tests  

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Approach
- Designed wireframes and user flows for vocabulary learning  
- Focused on minimizing repetitive user actions  
- Structured interfaces to support frequent review and learning  
- Prioritized clarity and ease of use for language learners
